CS207 Cryptogram Assignment

##### Completed by Karmen Tsang, Aqsa Hamid, Erin Allen and Sudeep Dhakal

The purpose of this assignment is to provide the opportunity to follow the software development lifecycle within a team. This is an important aspect of being
a professional in the field as it provides structure and consistency, resulting in projects which are more likely to be successful.

An important challenge here is to explore how the software development lifecycle can be applied in a given context. In the assessment for this semester of
Advanced Programming you will be asked to follow a software development lifecycle process in order to develop a Java program to allow users to generate
and solve cryptogram puzzles. 

## Project Aim

The aim is to develop software in Java which allows the user to play cryptogram puzzles. These puzzles should map letters to either letters or numbers.
