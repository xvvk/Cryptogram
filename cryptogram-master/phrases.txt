today is a beautiful sunny day
pizza is the best food on the planet
computer science is very complex
summer is coming soon i cannot wait
glasgow is a friendly city
spring is peaceful and beautiful
there is nothing to watch on netflix
i love all things chocolate
when will this pandemic end
the dentist is a scary place
the sky is blue the grass is green
i hate winter as it is too cold
the great british bake off is elite
one day i want to visit new york
i will learn to play the piano
